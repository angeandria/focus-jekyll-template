How to build multiple Jekyll sites on one computer


Building and managing multiple Jekyll sites on one computer involves creating separate directories for each site and ensuring that each site has its own configuration and dependencies. Here’s how you can do it:

Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create Directories for Each Site:
Create a separate directory for each Jekyll site you want to build.

mkdir ~/jekyll-sites
cd ~/jekyll-sites
mkdir site1 site2


2. Initialize Jekyll Sites:
Navigate to each directory and initialize a new Jekyll site.

cd site1
jekyll new .

cd ../site2
jekyll new .


3. Install Dependencies for Each Site:
Ensure that you install the necessary dependencies for each site using Bundler.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
bundle install

cd ../site2
bundle install


4. Serve Multiple Sites:
You can serve each site on different ports to avoid conflicts.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000

# Open a new terminal window or tab
cd ~/jekyll-sites/site2
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001


5. Access Your Sites:
Open your web browser and navigate to:

- http://localhost:4000 for Site 1
- http://localhost:4001 for Site 2

Optional: Automate the Process

To make it easier to manage multiple sites, you can create a simple shell script to serve all your sites at once.

#!/bin/bash

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000 &

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site2
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001 &

# Add more sites as needed

Save this script as serve_all_sites.sh, make it executable, and run it:

chmod +x serve_all_sites.sh
./serve_all_sites.sh

This will start serving all your sites at once, each on its specified port.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and serve multiple Jekyll sites from a single computer.


Is there a way to have my sites on better local url like
Mysite1.local
Mysite2.local


Yes, you can set up custom local URLs like mysite1.local and mysite2.local by editing your hosts file and configuring a local web server like Nginx. Here’s how you can do it:

Step 1: Edit the Hosts File

1. Open the hosts file with a text editor.

sudo nano /etc/hosts


2. Add the following lines to map the local URLs to localhost:

127.0.0.1 mysite1.local
127.0.0.1 mysite2.local


3. Save and close the file.

Step 2: Install and Configure Nginx

1. Install Nginx if you don’t already have it installed.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx


2. Create configuration files for each site in the Nginx sites-available directory.

For mysite1.local:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite1.local

Add the following configuration:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mysite1.local;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

For mysite2.local:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite2.local

Add the following configuration:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mysite2.local;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}


3. Enable the configuration by creating symbolic links to the sites-enabled directory.

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite1.local /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite2.local /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/


4. Test the Nginx configuration for syntax errors.

sudo nginx -t


5. Restart Nginx to apply the changes.

sudo systemctl restart nginx

Step 3: Serve Your Jekyll Sites

Start serving your Jekyll sites on the specified ports.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000

# Open a new terminal window or tab
cd ~/jekyll-sites/site2
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001

Step 4: Access Your Sites

Open your web browser and navigate to:

- http://mysite1.local for Site 1
- http://mysite2.local for Site 2

By following these steps, you can access your Jekyll sites using custom local URLs.


Where will the site be built


When you build a Jekyll site, the static files for the site are generated in a directory called _site within your Jekyll project's root directory. This is where the compiled HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets will be stored.

Example Directory Structure

Assuming you have a Jekyll site set up in ~/jekyll-sites/site1, your directory structure would look something like this:

~/jekyll-sites/site1
├── _config.yml
├── _posts
├── _site
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── about
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── css
│   │   └── main.css
│   └── ...
├── index.md
└── ...

Steps to Build the Site

1. Navigate to Your Site Directory:

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1


2. Build the Site:
Use Jekyll to build the site, which will generate the _site directory.

bundle exec jekyll build


3. Serve the Site:
When you serve the site using:

bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000

Jekyll will build the site and place the files in the _site directory. The server will then serve the static files from this _site directory.

Accessing the Built Site

- The built site files are located in ~/jekyll-sites/site1/_site.
- When you access http://mysite1.local (using Nginx as configured earlier), Nginx will serve the files from this directory.

Summary

- Build Directory: The built site files are located in the _site directory within your Jekyll project.
- Serving: The Nginx server proxies requests to the Jekyll server running on localhost:4000 or localhost:4001, which serves the files from the _site directory.


If i wanted to use that Jekyll for GitHub pages automated Jekyll build does it mean I should push the GitHub repo and exclude _site from being pushed?


Yes, if you are using Jekyll for GitHub Pages, you should exclude the _site directory from being pushed to your GitHub repository. GitHub Pages has an automated build process that generates the static files from your Jekyll source files. Including the _site directory is unnecessary and can cause issues.

Steps to Set Up Your Jekyll Site for GitHub Pages

1. Create a .gitignore File:
Ensure you have a .gitignore file in your Jekyll project directory to exclude the _site directory and other unnecessary files.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
touch .gitignore

Add the following lines to .gitignore:

_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata
node_modules/


2. Initialize a Git Repository:
If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory.

git init


3. Commit Your Source Files:
Add and commit your Jekyll source files to the repository.

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Jekyll site"


4. Create a GitHub Repository:
Create a new repository on GitHub for your Jekyll site.


5. Add the Remote Repository:
Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local repository.

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


6. Push Your Changes:
Push your local changes to the GitHub repository.

git push -u origin main

Configuring GitHub Pages

1. GitHub Pages Settings:
Go to your repository on GitHub, navigate to the "Settings" tab, and scroll down to the "Pages" section.


2. Source Branch:
Select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (typically main or gh-pages). If you are using the root directory, select / (root).

Summary

- Exclude _site: Ensure the _site directory is excluded from your repository by adding it to .gitignore.
- Commit Source Files: Only commit your Jekyll source files (e.g., _config.yml, _posts/, etc.).
- GitHub Pages Build: GitHub will automatically build and serve your site using Jekyll based on the committed source files.

By following these steps, you can set up your Jekyll site to be built and served automatically by GitHub Pages without including the _site directory in your repository.


Can’t I edit files using sublime text
Instead of nano?

You can now navigate through your project files in the left sidebar and open any file for editing by clicking on it. For instance, you can open and edit _config.yml, .gitignore, or any of your markdown files under _posts.

Example: Editing .gitignore in Sublime Text

1. Open Sublime Text.


2. Open your Jekyll project folder (~/jekyll-sites/site1).


3. In the left sidebar, find and click on .gitignore.


4. Add the following lines to .gitignore:

_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata
node_modules/


5. Save the file (File -> Save or Ctrl+S).

Example: Editing _config.yml in Sublime Text

1. Open Sublime Text.
2. Open your Jekyll project folder (~/jekyll-sites/site1).
3. In the left sidebar, find and click on _config.yml.
4. Make any necessary changes to your configuration.
5. Save the file (File -> Save or Ctrl+S).

Launching Sublime Text from Terminal

If you prefer working from the terminal but want to use Sublime Text for editing, you can set up a command to launch Sublime Text directly from the terminal.

1. Create a Symlink (Optional):
Create a symbolic link to make subl command available in the terminal.

ln -s /path/to/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/subl

Replace /path/to/sublime_text with the actual path to the Sublime Text executable.


2. Open Files or Folders:

- To open a specific file:subl ~/jekyll-sites/site1/.gitignore


- To open the entire project folder:subl ~/jekyll-sites/site1

By using Sublime Text, you can take advantage of a powerful text editor with features like syntax highlighting, multiple selections, and a user-friendly interface, making it easier to manage your Jekyll project files.

Open your web browser and navigate to:

- http://mysite1.local for Site 1
- http://mysite2.local for Site 2

By following these steps, you can access your Jekyll sites using custom local URLs.


Where will the site be built?




When you build a Jekyll site, the static files for the site are generated in a directory called _site within your Jekyll project's root directory. This is where the compiled HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets will be stored.

Example Directory Structure

Assuming you have a Jekyll site set up in ~/jekyll-sites/site1, your directory structure would look something like this:

~/jekyll-sites/site1
├── _config.yml
├── _posts
├── _site
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── about
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── css
│   │   └── main.css
│   └── ...
├── index.md
└── ...

Steps to Build the Site

1. Navigate to Your Site Directory:

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1


2. Build the Site:
 Use Jekyll to build the site, which will generate the _site directory.

bundle exec jekyll build


3. Serve the Site:
 When you serve the site using:

bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000

 Jekyll will build the site and place the files in the _site directory. The server will then serve the static files from this _site directory.

Accessing the Built Site

- The built site files are located in ~/jekyll-sites/site1/_site.
- When you access http://mysite1.local (using Nginx as configured earlier), Nginx will serve the files from this directory.

Summary

- Build Directory: The built site files are located in the _site directory within your Jekyll project.
- Serving: The Nginx server proxies requests to the Jekyll server running on localhost:4000 or localhost:4001, which serves the files from the _site directory.


If I wanted to use that Jekyll for GitHub Pages automated Jekyll build does it mean I should push the GitHub repo and exclude _site from being pushed?




Yes, if you are using Jekyll for GitHub Pages, you should exclude the _site directory from being pushed to your GitHub repository. GitHub Pages has an automated build process that generates the static files from your Jekyll source files. Including the _site directory is unnecessary and can cause issues.

Steps to Set Up Your Jekyll Site for GitHub Pages

1. Create a .gitignore File:
 Ensure you have a .gitignore file in your Jekyll project directory to exclude the _site directory and other unnecessary files.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1
touch .gitignore

 Add the following lines to .gitignore:

_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
.jekyll-metadata
node_modules/


2. Initialize a Git Repository:
 If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory.

git init


3. Commit Your Source Files:
 Add and commit your Jekyll source files to the repository.

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Jekyll site"


4. Create a GitHub Repository:
 Create a new repository on GitHub for your Jekyll site.


5. Add the Remote Repository:
 Add the GitHub repository as a remote to your local repository.

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


6. Push Your Changes:
 Push your local changes to the GitHub repository.

git push -u origin main

Configuring GitHub Pages

1. GitHub Pages Settings:
  Go to your repository on GitHub, navigate to the "Settings" tab, and scroll down to the "Pages" section.


2. Source Branch:
  Select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (typically main or gh-pages). If you are using the root directory, select / (root).

Summary

- Exclude _site: Ensure the _site directory is excluded from your repository by adding it to .gitignore.
- Commit Source Files: Only commit your Jekyll source files (e.g., _config.yml, _posts/, etc.).
- GitHub Pages Build: GitHub will automatically build and serve your site using Jekyll based on the committed source files.

By following these steps, you can set up your Jekyll site to be built and served automatically by GitHub Pages without including the _site directory in your repository.

Launching Sublime Text from Terminal

If you prefer working from the terminal but want to use Sublime Text for editing, you can set up a command to launch Sublime Text directly from the terminal.

1. Create a Symlink (Optional):
  Create a symbolic link to make subl command available in the terminal.

ln -s /path/to/sublime_text /usr/local/bin/subl 

  Replace /path/to/sublime_text with the actual path to the Sublime Text executable.


2. Open Files or Folders: 

- To open a specific file:subl ~/jekyll-sites/site1/.gitignore 


- To open the entire project folder:subl ~/jekyll-sites/site1

By using Sublime Text, you can take advantage of a powerful text editor with features like syntax highlighting, multiple selections, and a user-friendly interface, making it easier to manage your Jekyll project files.


If I want to use plugins (gemfile) locally do I need to do some extra?




Yes, if you want to use plugins locally in your Jekyll site, you need to manage your dependencies with a Gemfile. Here's how to set it up:

Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create a Gemfile:
  In your Jekyll project directory, create a Gemfile if it doesn't already exist.

cd ~/jekyll-sites/site1 
touch Gemfile 


2. Edit the Gemfile: 
  Open the Gemfile in Sublime Text or your preferred text editor and add the necessary content. Here's an example:

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.0'
gem 'jekyll-paginate' # Example plugin 
gem 'jekyll-seo-tag' # Example plugin 


3. Install Bundler: 
  If you haven't already installed Bundler, do so by running:

gem install bundler 


4. Install Dependencies: 
  Use Bundler to install the dependencies specified in your Gemfile.

bundle install 


5. Update _config.yml: 
  Ensure you include the plugins in your _config.yml file. For example:

plugins:
    - jekyll-paginate 
    - jekyll-seo-tag 


6. Serve Your Site with Bundler: 
  Always use Bundler to serve your Jekyll site to ensure all plugins are loaded correctly.

bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000

Example Gemfile and _config.yml

Gemfile:

source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.0' 
gem 'jekyll-paginate' 
gem 'jekyll-seo-tag' 

_config.yml:

title: My Jekyll Site description: A simple Jekyll site with plugins

# Other configurations...

plugins:
  - jekyll-paginate 
  - jekyll-seo-tag 

paginate: 5 paginate_path: "/page:num/" 

Summary

- Create a Gemfile: Specify your Jekyll version and any plugins you want to use.
- Install Bundler: Ensure Bundler is installed to manage dependencies.
- Run bundle install: Install the dependencies specified in your Gemfile.
- Update _config.yml: Add the plugins to the plugins section.
- Serve with Bundler: Use bundle exec jekyll serve to ensure all plugins are loaded.

By following these steps, you can easily manage and use Jekyll plugins locally on your development environment.
